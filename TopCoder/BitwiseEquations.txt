PROBLEM STATEMENT

You are given two positive integers x and k. Return the k-th smallest positive integer y (where k is 1-based) for which the following equation holds:
x + y = x | y
where '|' denotes the bitwise OR operator.



DEFINITION
Class:BitwiseEquations
Method:kthPlusOrSolution
Parameters:int, int
Returns:long
Method signature:long kthPlusOrSolution(int x, int k)


CONSTRAINTS
-x will be between 1 and 2,000,000,000, inclusive.
-k will be between 1 and 2,000,000,000, inclusive.


EXAMPLES

0)
5
1

Returns: 2

The first positive integer for which the equation holds is 2.
You can check that 5+2=7 as well as 5|2=7. Both plus and bitwise OR look like the following:

 101
+ 10
 ---
 111



1)
5
5

Returns: 18

The fifth number for which the equation 5 + y = 5 | y holds is 18. The first four solutions are 2,8,10,16.
The binary sum for 18 looks like the following:

   101
+10010
 -----
 10111


2)
10
3

Returns: 5

The third solution is 5. The first two solutions are 1 and 4.


3)
